LaGriSU v 0.2 (Landslide Grid and Slope Units): binary (1,0) samples extraction tool pack for landslides mapping in QGIS

**Omar F. AlThuwaynee**, *Developer* 

## Introduction
* LaGriSU, designed specifically for landslide mapping  applications,  developed in QGIS tool box modeler, The  Tool  Pack  does not requires  an  internet  connection or Java runtime environment at any stage (just copy and paste the modules in models library).
* The first version of QGIS.GSU V.01 was released in 2018, presented in online course “” as part of landslide susceptibility mapping tutorials. Since that time, 200 user was download and used the tool, and that let us collect all the complains, bugs, workability issues to be fix in the current V0.2.
* Tool provided a user-friendly experience to systematically learn (open box), visualize and validate the extracted samples stored in many different resultant layers (before and after to be merged), and to update the extracted samples whenever the features homogeneity was disturbed. 
* Furthermore, the tool does not need any programing or advance GIS skills to be executed.
